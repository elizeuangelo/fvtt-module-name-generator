# Folder Structure and Configuration

The folder to be selected on the module's configuration should contain the subfolders: `portraits/` _(necessary)_ and `tokens/` _(optional)_. For example, this folder `imgs/` is a valid selection.

## (imgs/portraits/) Tags and Images

All images inside the `portraits` folder should be cataloged using the `_` character as a tag separator. Use the images provided in that folder folder as an example for building your own portrait database.

Disclaimer: This directory is a template so you can set up your own imgs directory. Your directory should be in the userdata directory or you are at risk of losing images in case the module updates.

## (imgs/tokens/) Premade Tokens

The module will check wether an image with the same name as the portrait exists inside this folder (ignoring the extension). If true, it will use it as a token.

Disclaimer: This directory is a template so you can set up your own imgs directory. Your directory should be in the userdata directory or you are at risk of losing images in case the module updates.
