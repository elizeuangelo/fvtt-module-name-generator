### Reskining a Character üßë‚Äçü¶±

You can also reskin a generic character, changing its name and/or portrait. Optionally, you can set for it to update all found names inside the character data and embedded items.

### Portraits üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

To configure portrait generation you need to create a folder like the one found in `name-generator/imgs/portraits`. From there, enter the module configuration and select the folder in the `Portrait Directory` setting.

All images inserted into the directory with the correct format will be available as a portrait to be randomly generated.

#### Image Name Format

All images in the directory should have their names formatted as the examples in the `imgs/portraits` folder, the module uses their names as tags for matching pictures, following the rules:

-   All names should be in lower-case;
-   An underline (`_`) act as a separator for different tags, you can have as many tags as you want for any picture and might use spaces as well;
-   The tags from the entire folder becomes individual filters as well, so adding a new tag to any image also adds a new filter;
-   Jobs and races are automatically matched using their lower-case title;
-   If no match is found for the applied filters, no image is returned;
